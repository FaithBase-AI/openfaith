# Person

A Planning Center `Person` record that has been added to Giving.

The `Person` object in Planning Center is so crucial that we have an entire product dedicated to managing, keeping track of, editing, and creating these records and metadata around them. For additional info, take a look at the [Planning Center People API Docs](https://developer.planning.center/docs/#/apps/people).
