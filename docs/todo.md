This main README is looking excellent! It's comprehensive, clearly outlines the vision and key architectural decisions, and now effectively links out to more detailed documents.

Based on what you have and the typical needs for a project of this scope, here's a list of other READMEs or detailed documents (beyond what you've already listed as created or planned in "Key Docs") that would be highly beneficial for the OpenFaith project. I'll categorize them for clarity.

**I. Core Concepts & Architecture (Expanding on existing ideas or new deep dives):**

3.  **`JobQueue.md` (Background Task Management):**

    - Detail the choice for the job queue system (e.g., PostgreSQL-based for V1, or BullMQ/Redis).
    - How it's used for:
      - Sync engine tasks (polling, batch processing).
      - Rate limit management for API calls made by Adapters.
      - Retry mechanisms for failed operations.
      - Scheduled tasks (like the 15-min partial sync cron, token refresh).

**II. Developer Guides & Contribution:**

6.  **`BuildingAnAdapter.md` (Guide to Creating a New ChMS Adapter):**

    - Detailed breakdown of the `ChMSAdapter` interface/base class.
    - Step-by-step guide:
      - Setting up the module structure.
      - Implementing authentication logic for the new ChMS.
      - Defining methods for fetching and transforming each entity (list, read, create, update).
      - Handling pagination, rate limits, and specific API quirks.
      - Writing transformation functions to/from the OpenFaith CDM.
      - Implementing webhook handlers.
      - Testing the adapter.
    - Best practices and common patterns.

7.  **`UsingTheFrontendSDK.md` (Guide for App Developers):**

    - How to install and set up the OpenFaith Frontend SDK in a React project.
    - Detailed API documentation for components like `<OpenFaithTable>`, `<OpenFaithForm>`, and individual field components.
    - Examples of how to customize the default `shadcn/ui` components.
    - How to use the dynamic table/form definition generators.
    - Integrating with the client sync engine (Zero) using the provided hooks.

8.  **`AIInteractionDevelopment.md` (Guide for Extending AI Capabilities):**
    - How to define new "AI tools" for CDM entities or custom actions.
    - Best practices for writing tool descriptions that LLMs can understand.
    - How the LLM Orchestration Layer discovers and uses these tools.
    - Guidelines for implementing the secure SQL fallback (validation, sanitization).

**III. Operational & Deployment:**

9.  **`Deployment.md` (Deploying OpenFaith):**

    - Instructions for deploying the OpenFaith backend (core API, sync engine, job queue).
    - Instructions for deploying `zero-cache` (tying into Zero's own deployment docs).
    - Configuration management (environment variables).
    - Scaling considerations.
    - Backup and recovery strategies.

10. **`MonitoringAndObservability.md`:**
    - Key metrics to monitor for the OpenFaith platform (API performance, sync job success/failure rates, queue lengths, database performance).
    - Logging strategy.
    - Integration with tracing systems (e.g., OpenTelemetry).

**IV. Community & Ecosystem:**

11. **`Roadmap.md` (Public Roadmap):**

    - Short-term, medium-term, and long-term goals for the project.
    - Major features planned.
    - (You might already have this, but ensuring it's detailed and public).

12. **`Specification.md` (OpenFaith Integration Spec - for 3rd party apps):**
    - If third-party apps are to integrate directly with OpenFaith (not just via ChMS sync), this would detail the OpenFaith API, authentication for apps, event subscription, etc. This is a more advanced/future document.

**Prioritization:**

You don't need all of these on day one. I'd prioritize:

- **Deep dives into core concepts already linked:** `Permissions.md` should be high on the list as it's complex and critical.
- **Operational:** A basic `Deployment.md` will be needed relatively early.

The "Zero" docs you provided are a good example of how to structure a `/docs` directory with many focused markdown files covering different aspects of the system. OpenFaith can follow a similar, well-organized approach.
