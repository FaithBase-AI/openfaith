# Contributing to OpenFaith: Building for the Kingdom Together

Welcome, fellow servant and builder! We are thrilled you're considering contributing to OpenFaith. This project is more than just code; it's an act of stewardship, a response to a call to serve the global Body of Christ in a new and unified way.

Our deepest conviction is that the future of technology serving the Church is **open and collaborative**. For too long, we've seen walls where bridges should be, competition where kingdom-minded cooperation is needed. OpenFaith is our step of faith towards a different model â€“ one where we work together, as members of one Body, to build tools that advance His Kingdom.

> "I no longer live, but Christ now lives in me." (Galatians 2:20)

This scripture is at the heart of our motivation. We believe that when our work is defined by our theology and a desire to serve the King, our roadmaps, our choices, and our impact will be transformed. OpenFaith is an invitation to lay down our individual brands, our competitive spirits, and our self-focused ambitions for the sake of building up our Father's house together.

> "That they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me." (John 17:21)

### Our Guiding Principles for Contribution

As we build OpenFaith, we are guided by these principles, rooted in our shared faith:

1.  **Kingdom First:** Our primary aim is the advancement of God's Kingdom and the equipping of His Church. Features, designs, and technical decisions should be weighed against this ultimate goal. Does this help the Church fulfill the Great Commission? Does it serve the King?
2.  **Unity & Collaboration:** We strive to embody the unity Jesus prayed for. This means fostering a collaborative environment where ideas are shared freely, help is offered generously, and credit is given where it's due. The world competes; the Kingdom works together.
3.  **Stewardship & Excellence:** We are stewards of the talents and resources God has given us. We aim to build with excellence, creating software that is robust, reliable, and a blessing to those who use it.
4.  **Openness & Generosity:** He gave it all, so we give everything we have. We aim to share our work freely, build in the open, and create an ecosystem that benefits all.
5.  **Servant Leadership:** We approach this project as bondservants, seeking to serve the needs of the Church rather than our own agendas. Our reward is in heaven.
