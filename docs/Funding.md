## Supporting OpenFaith: Partnering in the Mission

OpenFaith is an open-source project driven by a vision to serve the global Church and equip ministries with powerful, interconnected data tools. Our commitment is to keep the core platform and its specifications open and freely available to foster widespread adoption, collaboration, and innovation.

To sustain this work, cover operational costs (hosting, infrastructure, etc.), and enable dedicated development and community support, OpenFaith relies on the generosity of individuals, churches, ministries, and organizations who believe in this mission.

### Our Funding Model: Donations & Sponsorships

We have chosen a **donation and sponsorship-based funding model** because it aligns with our Kingdom-first principles and our desire to offer these foundational tools as a gift to the Body of Christ. This is not about building a commercial empire, but about stewarding a resource for the common good of the Church.

> "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." (2 Corinthians 9:7)

We believe that if this project brings value and aligns with God's purposes, He will provide for its needs through His people.

**How Your Support Helps:**

*   **Dedicated Development:** Enables core contributors to dedicate focused time to building and maintaining the OpenFaith platform, core libraries, and essential ChMS Adapters.
*   **Infrastructure Costs:** Covers expenses for servers, databases, CI/CD pipelines, domain names, and other operational necessities.
*   **Community Support & Documentation:** Helps us provide excellent documentation, tutorials, and support for developers and organizations adopting OpenFaith.
*   **Long-Term Sustainability:** Ensures OpenFaith can continue to evolve, adapt to new technologies, and serve the Church effectively for years to come.

### Ways to Support OpenFaith

We are exploring and aim to set up the following channels for financial partnership:

1.  **Individual Donations:**
    *   One-time or recurring donations from individuals who are passionate about this vision and want to see it succeed.
    *   We plan to use platforms like **GitHub Sponsors**, **Give Send Go**, or a dedicated donation page on an OpenFaith website.

2.  **Church & Ministry Sponsorships:**
    *   Churches, denominations, and ministry organizations that anticipate benefiting from OpenFaith can become official sponsors.
    *   Sponsorship tiers might be available, offering different levels of recognition (e.g., logo placement on a website, acknowledgments in project updates).
    *   This is an opportunity for ministries to invest in infrastructure that will ultimately serve them and the broader Church.

3.  **Corporate & Business Sponsorships:**
    *   Companies that serve the church tech space, or businesses whose values align with the OpenFaith mission, are welcome to become sponsors.
    *   This could include ChMS vendors who wish to support interoperability, development agencies building on OpenFaith, or other technology providers.

4.  **Grants & Foundations:**
    *   We may seek grants from foundations or organizations that support open-source initiatives or technology for ministry.

**Non-Financial Contributions:**

While financial support is crucial, we also deeply value non-financial contributions as outlined in our [Contributors.md](/docs/Contributors.md) â€“ your time, code, documentation, testing, feedback, and prayers are all vital to OpenFaith's success.

### Transparency and Stewardship

We are committed to being good stewards of any funds received. We plan to:

*   Operate with transparency regarding how funds are used (e.g., through regular updates or a public financial overview.
*   Prioritize spending on core development, essential infrastructure, and community support.
*   Ensure that the project remains true to its open-source and Kingdom-focused mission.
