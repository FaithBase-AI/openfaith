# Adapter Architecture Refactoring Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines the refactoring of OpenFaith's adapter system to support multiple Church Management Systems (ChMS) through a unified, type-safe architecture. The current system is tightly coupled to Planning Center Online (PCO), and we need to abstract it to support additional adapters like Church Community Builder (CCB) while maintaining full type safety.

## Current State

- PCO-specific implementations scattered across the codebase
- Direct dependencies on `PcoHttpClient` and `pcoEntityManifest` in workflows
- Hard-coded PCO logic in sync operations
- No abstraction layer for different ChMS providers

## Target Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Abstract Operations Interface** (`adapter-core`)

   - Defines common operations all adapters must implement
   - Provides type-safe abstraction for workflows
   - No generics - uses concrete interfaces

2. **Adapter-Specific Services** (`adapters/pco`, `adapters/ccb`)

   - Each adapter implements the abstract operations
   - Maintains full type safety with adapter-specific types
   - Encapsulates adapter-specific logic (HTTP clients, entity manifests)

3. **Adapter Registry** (`adapters/every-adapter`)

   - Maps adapter tags to implementations
   - Provides unified access to any adapter
   - Handles adapter selection based on token/configuration

4. **Updated Workflows**
   - Work with abstract operations interface
   - No knowledge of specific adapter implementations
   - No casting or type hacks required
