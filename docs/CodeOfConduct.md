# OpenFaith Contributor Code of Conduct: Serving Christ Together

## Our Foundation: Discipleship in Action

OpenFaith is a project dedicated to serving the Church and advancing the Kingdom of God. As such, our interactions and contributions are to be guided by the teachings of Holy Scripture and our shared identity as disciples and servants of Jesus Christ. Our conduct in this community is an extension of our worship and our commitment to Him.

> "Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ." (Colossians 3:23-24)

> "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." (Ephesians 4:1-3)

This Code of Conduct outlines how these principles translate into our collaborative work on OpenFaith. It is not merely a set of rules, but an understanding of how we, as those who "no longer live, but Christ lives in us" (Galatians 2:20), should operate together for His glory.

## Our Standards of Conduct: Reflecting Christ

As contributors to OpenFaith, striving to be bondservants of Christ, we commit to:

1.  **Humility and Teachability:**

    - Recognizing that all wisdom and skill come from God, we approach tasks and discussions with a humble spirit, willing to learn from others and submit to godly counsel. (Philippians 2:3, Proverbs 15:33)
    - We value the contributions of others, regardless of their level of experience, and seek to build one another up.

2.  **Love and Respect for Brethren:**

    - Treating every member of the community with the love and respect due to a fellow brother or sister in Christ, and indeed to all people as made in God's image. (John 13:34-35, Romans 12:10)
    - Avoiding partiality and showing honor to one another.

3.  **Truthfulness and Integrity:**

    - Speaking truth in love, ensuring our communications are honest, edifying, and gracious. (Ephesians 4:15, 25, 29)
    - Maintaining integrity in our code, our commitments, and our interactions.

4.  **Patience and Grace:**

    - Exercising patience and extending grace to others, understanding that we all have different strengths, weaknesses, and rates of growth. (Ephesians 4:2, Colossians 3:13)
    - Being quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger. (James 1:19)

5.  **Encouragement and Edification:**

    - Actively seeking to encourage and build up fellow contributors in their work and faith. (1 Thessalonians 5:11, Hebrews 10:24-25)
    - Focusing on constructive feedback offered in a spirit of help and mutual improvement.

6.  **Unity and a Focus on Shared Mission:**
    - Striving for unity in the Spirit, putting aside personal preferences or ambitions for the greater goal of serving the Kingdom through this project. (Philippians 1:27, John 17:21)
    - Remembering that our collective effort is to build tools that serve our Father's house.

## Conduct Inconsistent with Our Calling

Behaviors that hinder our mission, grieve the Holy Spirit, and are not in keeping with our commitment as servants of Christ include, but are not limited to:

1.  **Slander, Gossip, Malice, and Divisive Behavior:**
    - Spreading unsubstantiated rumors, speaking ill of others privately or publicly, or engaging in actions that create factions or strife within the community. (Ephesians 4:31, Titus 3:9-11, Proverbs 6:16-19)
2.  **Arrogance, Self-Promotion, and Contentiousness:**
    - Exalting oneself, seeking personal glory over the success of the project or the edification of others, or engaging in arguments driven by pride rather than a pursuit of truth and the best outcome for the project. (Philippians 2:3-4, Proverbs 13:10)
3.  **Dishonesty or Deception:**
    - Misrepresenting facts, plagiarizing work, or any form of deceit.
4.  **Harshness, Unwholesome Talk, or Personal Attacks:**
    - Using abusive, demeaning, or consistently critical language that tears down rather than builds up. (Ephesians 4:29, Colossians 4:6)
5.  **Willful Disregard for Project Direction or Community Health:**
    - Persistently working against established project goals (after due discussion) or engaging in behavior that is clearly detrimental to the collaborative spirit and Kingdom focus of OpenFaith.
6.  **Harassment or Intimidation:**
    - Any form of behavior intended to intimidate, bully, or create a hostile environment for another contributor.

## Accountability and Restoration: A Scriptural Approach

As a community seeking to honor Christ, we will address conduct inconsistent with these standards with a heart for both righteousness and restoration, guided by principles such as those found in Matthew 18:15-17.

1.  **Personal Reconciliation:** If a contributor is offended or observes conduct inconsistent with these standards, they are encouraged, as a first step and where appropriate, to address the individual privately and graciously, seeking understanding and reconciliation.
2.  **Mediation by Stewards:** If private resolution is not possible or appropriate, or if the behavior persists, the matter should be brought to the attention of the project maintainers (stewards). The stewards will seek to understand the situation, mediate if possible, and provide counsel. This may involve one or two maintainers speaking with the individuals involved.
3.  **Stewardship Decision:** If the conduct remains unaddressed or is of a serious nature, the project maintainers, after prayerful consideration and seeking wisdom, will determine appropriate action. This is a weighty responsibility, undertaken with a view to:
    - The spiritual health and integrity of the OpenFaith community.
    - The effective pursuit of the project's Kingdom mission.
    - The principle of restoration for the individual, where possible and godly.
4.  **Consequences:** Actions taken by maintainers may range from private admonishment and a call to repentance, to a request for public apology (if the offense was public), to temporary suspension from contribution, or, in cases of persistent and unrepentant harmful behavior, permanent removal from the project community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by the OpenFaith project, including (but not limited to) GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, and any official communication channels (e.g., Discord, forums). It also applies when an individual is acting as an official representative of OpenFaith.

## Reporting Concerns

Concerns regarding conduct should be brought to the project maintainers via DM. Reports will be treated with discretion, prayerful consideration, and a commitment to biblical principles of justice and mercy.

## Our Ultimate Standard

While this document provides guidelines, our ultimate Code of Conduct is the Word of God, and our ultimate example is the Lord Jesus Christ. May all our efforts in OpenFaith be pleasing to Him and serve to build up His Church.
