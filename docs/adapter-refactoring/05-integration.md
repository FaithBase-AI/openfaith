- [ ] No PCO-specific error types in workflow code
- [ ] All operations go through `AdapterOperations` interface

### Task 5.2.2: Update type definitions

**Objective**: Ensure type safety throughout the new system

**Files to examine**:

- All workflow and helper files
- Type definitions and interfaces
- Error type usage

**Effect docs context**:

- Search: "type safety"
- Search: "service types"

**Requirements**:

- Remove any `any` types introduced during migration
- Ensure proper error type propagation
- Validate service interface implementations
- Check for type consistency across adapters

### Task 5.2.3: Documentation updates

**Objective**: Update existing documentation to reflect new architecture

**Files to update**:

- `README.md`
- `docs/syncEngine/` documentation
- `AGENTS.md`

**Files to create**:

- `docs/adapters/adapter-development-guide.md`
- `docs/adapters/supported-adapters.md`

**Documentation requirements**:

- Update architecture diagrams
- Document adapter development process
- Update deployment and configuration guides
- Create troubleshooting guides for adapters

## Initiative 5.3: Comprehensive Testing

### Task 5.3.1: Integration testing

**Objective**: Test the complete system with multiple adapters

**Test scenarios**:

- PCO sync workflows with new architecture
- CCB sync workflows (when implemented)
- Mixed adapter environments
- Adapter switching and detection
- Error handling across adapters

**Files to create**:

- `backend/workers/__tests__/integration/adapter-registry.test.ts`
- `backend/workers/__tests__/integration/multi-adapter.test.ts`

**Effect docs context**:

- Search: "testing patterns"
- Search: "mock services"

### Task 5.3.2: Performance testing

**Objective**: Ensure new architecture doesn't impact performance

**Test requirements**:

- Benchmark sync performance vs. old system
- Memory usage analysis
- Adapter switching overhead
- Registry lookup performance

**Metrics to track**:

- Sync operation latency
- Memory consumption
- Error rates
- Throughput comparisons

### Task 5.3.3: End-to-end testing

**Objective**: Validate complete workflows with real adapters

**Test scenarios**:

- Full PCO sync cycle with timestamp updates
- External sync operations with multiple adapters
- Error recovery and retry scenarios
- Configuration changes and adapter reloading

## Initiative 5.4: Deployment and Rollout

### Task 5.4.1: Feature flag implementation

## Project Completion

Upon successful completion of all phases:

1. **Archive old PCO-specific code** that's no longer needed
2. **Update project roadmap** to reflect new adapter capabilities
3. **Plan future adapter implementations** using established patterns
4. **Conduct retrospective** to capture lessons learned
5. **Update team documentation** and training materials

The adapter architecture refactoring will be considered complete when all success criteria are met and the system is successfully running in production with multiple adapters.
